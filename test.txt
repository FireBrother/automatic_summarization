'' </s> <s> fury at the speaker has unk over since tuesday 's elections , when republicans suffered a net loss of five seats in the house . </s> <s> they blamed gingrich , the party 's chief strategist . </s> <s> but many were already angry at him for what they said was his failure to unk a clear message for the party going into the elections and for a messy budget process that gave president clinton a political edge and unk republican principles of fiscal unk by containing massive amounts of spending for local projects . </s> <s> house republicans are to meet nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot for their leaders . </s> <s> whoever wins the republican nomination for speaker must stand for election by the full house in january . </s> <s> even if gingrich wins the secret ballot , he could be denied re-election as speaker in january if salmon and at least five others refuse to vote for him . </s> <s> because the republicans now control the house by only 12 seats , it would take just six votes against gingrich to deny him a majority . </s> <s> with such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming , livingston told gingrich that he should step aside for the good of the party , republican officials said . </s> <s> the officials said that livingston spoke to gingrich shortly after the election returns but also before the election , reflecting livingston 's earlier displeasure with the speaker over the budget process . </s> <s> several republicans said that both livingston , the chairman of the appropriations committee and one of the few members with the stature to stand for speaker , and gingrich were working the phones on thursday in a struggle for votes . </s> <s> livingston has said nothing publicly about a challenge to gingrich , but several members and aides said on thursday that he would announce his intentions , possibly as soon as friday , only after he had determined if he could win . </s> <s> rep. peter king , r-n.y. , was one of several members who spoke with livingston on thursday . </s> <s> `` he told me he 's making a number of phone calls , that he 's gotten a very positive response about running for speaker , and he 'll decide within the next 48 hours , '' king said . </s> <s> `` he wo n't do it unk he has his unk in a row , and right now a lot of people are still loyal to the speaker , '' said an aide to a republican who , like many others , is trying to straddle the line between unk to a speaker who may retain power and unk to a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party . </s> <s> many republicans immediately blamed gingrich for the party 's losses on tuesday . </s> <s> talk quickly emerged the next day of a unk of candidates to oppose gingrich and his lieutenants . </s> <s> the list of possible candidates for leadership positions included unk steve unk of oklahoma , who talked with livingston on thursday about challenging gingrich , republican officials said , speaking on the condition that their names not be reported . </s> <s> those officials said that unk told livingston that he wanted to run with him on a ticket and that he would challenge rep. dick armey , the majority leader . </s> <s> but , these officials said that if livingston did not challenge gingrich , unk would run for speaker instead . </s> <s> other names were unk wednesday for leadership posts . </s> <s> they included reps. david unk of indiana for speaker and unk unk of washington as conference chairman . </s> <s> added to the mix on thursday was the name of rep. christopher unk , a california conservative . </s> <s> as a sign of the uncertainty prevailing among house members on thursday , rep. henry hyde , the chairman of the judiciary committee and one of the house 's most unk members , unk a chance to endorse gingrich as speaker . </s> <s> hyde said that gingrich bore responsibility for the party 's losses tuesday . </s> <s> `` leadership takes credit when things go right , '' he said . </s> <s> `` they ought to take the blame when things go wrong .
